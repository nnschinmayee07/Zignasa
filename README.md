# Zignasa event MVP
This project was developed as part of Zignasa, a college-level technical event, where I chose the Vibe-Coding domain. The challenge was to create a platform that allows students to deploy their projects online efficiently.
I approached the problem by identifying key pain points for students and hackathon participants:

Key Features
One-click project deployment
Automated testing and error detection
Security scanning for deployed projects
Portfolio-ready outputs for students
Intuitive interface requiring minimal technical knowledge

Approach & Learning
Analyzed the deployment workflow of typical student projects to identify bottlenecks
Designed an automated pipeline for testing, deployment, and security scanning
Ensured the platform is beginner-friendly while supporting hackathon-grade projects
Learned practical applications of web development, automation, and cloud integration

Target Users
College students
Hackathon participants
Learners who want to deploy projects quickly and securely
